### Week 10 Achievements:

* **Architecture Analysis Framework:**
  * Created a comprehensive document outlining the criteria for analyzing system architecture.
  * Defined a scoring system based on key metrics (Availability, Scalability, Security, Cost).

* **AWS Proficiency:**
  * Solidified understanding of basic AWS services by navigating both the Management Console and the Command Line Interface (CLI).
  * Validated the differences in workflow between GUI and CLI operations.

* **Manual Deployment (Clickops):**
  * Successfully deployed the project architecture manually ("Clickops") without IaC tools.
  * Gained a deep understanding of the underlying resource dependencies (VPC <-> SG <-> EC2 <-> DynamoDB) required for the system to function.

* **Professional Development:**
  * Attended the office workshop on **AI/ML and GenAI**.
  * Gained insights into how Generative AI can be integrated with current AWS services and potential use cases for future projects.
