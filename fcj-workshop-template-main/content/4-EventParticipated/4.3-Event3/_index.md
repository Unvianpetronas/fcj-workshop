# EVENT REPORT: AI/ML/GenAI on AWS

**Event Objective:** To provide foundational to advanced knowledge on AI/ML and Generative AI (GenAI) services on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) platform.

---

## 1. Welcome & Context (8:00 – 8:30 AM)

The event kicked off with participant registration and networking among professionals and attendees.

- An overview of learning objectives was provided, directing the content to focus on practical AWS tools.
- An introduction to the AI/ML landscape in Vietnam highlighted key trends and major challenges in the region.

---

## 2. AWS AI/ML Platform Overview (8:30 – 10:00 AM)

This segment focused on **Amazon SageMaker**, the end-to-end Machine Learning (ML) platform from AWS:

- **ML Lifecycle:** Attendees learned about the crucial stages, from data preparation and labeling to efficient model training, tuning, and deployment.
- **Integrated MLOps:** Introduction to the built-in MLOps capabilities in SageMaker, which help automate and manage the model lifecycle in production environments.
- **Live Demo - SageMaker Studio:** A live demonstration of SageMaker's integrated development environment (IDE), illustrating how data scientists can work effectively on the platform.

### 10:00 – 10:15 AM | Coffee Break (15 minutes)

---

## 3. Generative AI (GenAI) with Amazon Bedrock (10:15 AM – 11:30 AM)

After the coffee break, the focus shifted to GenAI via **Amazon Bedrock**, the hub for Foundation Models (FMs):

- **Foundation Models:** Analysis and comparison of leading FMs like Claude, Llama, and Titan, along with guidance on selecting the appropriate model for specific tasks.
- **Prompt Engineering:** Learning essential and advanced techniques, including Chain-of-Thought reasoning and Few-shot learning to optimize FM output.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** Introduction to the RAG architecture and the role of integrating a Knowledge Base to feed the FM proprietary information, enhancing accuracy.
- **Bedrock Agents & Guardrails:** Exploration of how Bedrock Agents enable the creation of automated multi-step workflows. Concurrently, learning about Guardrails to ensure safety and content filtering against harmful outputs.
- **Live Demo:** A practical demonstration of building a simple GenAI chatbot using Bedrock components.

### 11:30 AM | Finish & Lunch

Lunch Break (Self-arranged)

## GENERAL ASSESSMENT AND NEXT STEPS

### Assessment

The morning session successfully provided a strong foundation for both pillars of AI on AWS: SageMaker as the tool for traditional/custom ML, and Bedrock as the center for rapid GenAI adoption. The practical demos helped attendees clearly visualize the application capabilities of these services.

**Key Knowledge Acquired:** Understanding the end-to-end ML process on SageMaker and the core components of GenAI (FMs, RAG, Agents) within Bedrock.

### Proposed Next Steps

1. **Hands-on with Bedrock:** Begin experimenting with Prompt Engineering using one of the Foundation Models in Bedrock (e.g., Claude or Titan) to build a prototype application.
2. **Explore SageMaker:** Delve deeper into the MLOps features of SageMaker, focusing on automating the deployment and monitoring of models.
