During my internship at **AWS Vietnam** from **September 1, 2025** to **December 24, 2025**, I had the opportunity to learn, practice, and apply the knowledge acquired in school to a real-world working environment.

I participated in a **Production-Ready Cloud Monitoring Platform Project** (AWS Cloud Health Dashboard), through which I significantly improved my skills in **cloud architecture, DevSecOps, multi-tenant system design, cost optimization, security engineering, Python/FastAPI backend development, React frontend development, and comprehensive AWS service integration (17+ services)**.

In terms of work ethic, I consistently strived to deliver production-quality solutions, proactively identified and resolved critical bugs, implemented cost-saving measures that reduced monthly operational expenses, and actively collaborated with mentors to continuously improve the platform's architecture and security posture.

To objectively reflect on my internship period, I would like to evaluate myself based on the following criteria:
