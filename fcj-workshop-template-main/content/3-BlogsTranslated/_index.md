###  [Blog 1 - How Smartsheet Reduced Latency and Optimized Costs in Their Serverless Architecture](3.1-Blog1)
This article presents a real-world case study of Smartsheet - a leading enterprise work management platform - on how they optimized their serverless architecture to achieve an **83% reduction in P95 latency** and cost optimization. Through implementing provisioned concurrency with auto scaling and migrating to AWS Graviton, Smartsheet successfully addressed cold start issues in a real-time event processing environment handling tens of thousands of events per second. The article provides detailed insights into event-driven architecture, latency challenges in collaborative platforms, and an optimization blueprint that can be applied by other organizations deploying enterprise-scale serverless architectures.
